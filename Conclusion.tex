\section{Conclusion}
From the experiments, it is observed that Oracle, where there is unlimited message sharing, has the best performance. However this can never be applied in a real time scenario where there can only be limited message sharing among agents acting in any field (e.g. a battlefield). Also, we have seen that the performance is poor in the case of independent agents, which implies that message sharing is important in a multi-agent environment. From our results, we can also see that the difference in performance between the MARL AI algorithms is negligable leaving room for further development and future improvement.
